        <h2>My Journey</h2>
        <p>
            My fascination with computer science began at an early age. I honed my interest in high school, attending a magnet program
            specializing in computer science. For my undergraduate studies, I attended the illustrious Tuskegee University, where
            I earned a Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Science in 2017. Since then, my passion has grown into a fulfilling career in
            the defense industry, where I now work as a Test Manager at L3Harris Technologies.
        </p>
        <p>
            My career has been fast-paced and rewarding. As a Systems Integration and Test Engineer, I’ve received accolades such as the
            L3Harris E3 Engineering award. I currently specialize in test engineering and automation, leading efforts to streamline processes
            and achieve significant efficiencies. Simultaneously, I am pursuing a Master’s degree in Software Development at Boston University to further
            enhance my expertise.
